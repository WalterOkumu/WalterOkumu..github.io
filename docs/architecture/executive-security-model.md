## 2. Current Security Posture Analysis

### 2.1 Technical Security Assessment ✅

#### STRENGTHS IDENTIFIED:

**Next.js 15 Security Configuration** (`/next.config.mjs`)
```javascript
// ✅ Security headers implemented
poweredByHeader: false,
reactStrictMode: true,

// ✅ Image security controls
dangerouslyAllowSVG: true,
contentSecurityPolicy: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; sandbox;",
```

**Input Sanitization Framework** (`/src/lib/sanitize.js`)
```javascript
// ✅ Comprehensive XSS protection
- HTML tag removal and entity encoding
- Control character filtering
- Length limits (10,000 chars text, 50,000 chars message)
- Protocol validation (https/http only)
- Email format validation with RFC 5321 compliance
```

**Contact Form Security** (`/src/app/api/contact/route.js`)
```javascript
// ✅ Multi-layer security controls
- Rate limiting: 5 requests/15 minutes per IP
- Input validation and sanitization
- Email format validation
- Message length validation (min 10 chars)
- SMTP TLS encryption configuration
```

**Environment Variable Security** (`/src/lib/env.js`)
```javascript
// ✅ Secure configuration management
- Validation and fallback mechanisms
- URL format validation
- Email format validation with regex
- Development-only warning system
- Safe type conversion (boolean, numeric)
```

### 2.2 Security Gaps Identified ⚠️

#### CRITICAL GAPS:
1. **Missing Content Security Policy Headers**
   - No CSP implementation in main application
   - Only image-specific CSP in next.config.mjs
   - Risk: XSS attacks via inline scripts/styles

2. **Insufficient HTTP Security Headers**
   - Missing HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
   - No X-Frame-Options protection
   - No X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - Risk: Clickjacking, MIME type sniffing attacks

3. **Analytics Privacy Concerns**
   - Google Analytics without consent management
   - Yandex Metrica with extensive tracking
   - Executive behavior profiling exposure
   - Risk: Executive surveillance, GDPR non-compliance

4. **Secrets Management**
   - Environment variables visible in client-side code
   - SMTP credentials in server environment
   - Risk: Credential exposure, email compromise
