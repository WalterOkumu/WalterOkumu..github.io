```css
/* Full-width sections with smart inner containers */
.section-fullwidth {
  width: 100vw;
  margin-left: calc(-50vw + 50%);
  padding: var(--section-padding) calc(50vw - 50%);
}

/* Asymmetric layouts for visual interest */
.layout-asymmetric {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1.618fr 1fr; /* Golden ratio */
}
```

### **Pattern 2: Progressive Enhancement Animations**
```css
/* Respect motion preferences while providing rich experience */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .enhanced-animation {
    transform: translateY(20px);
    opacity: 0;
    transition: all 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94);
  }

  .enhanced-animation.in-view {
    transform: translateY(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

### **Pattern 3: Fluid Typography System**
```css
/* Perfect scaling across all devices */
.heading-fluid {
  font-size: clamp(2rem, 4vw + 1rem, 5rem);
  line-height: clamp(1.1, 0.95 + 0.1vw, 1.2);
}
```
