## ðŸ”„ Coordination Framework

### Cross-Agent Communication Protocol
1. **Evidence-First Reporting:** All progress updates must include concrete artifacts (file paths, commit SHAs, URLs)
2. **Task Progress Updates:** Real-time updates in `task-progress.md` with [ðŸ”„] active status indicators
3. **Handoff Coordination:** Clear acceptance criteria completion before handoff to target agents
4. **Dependency Management:** A5 waits for A18 completion; parallel execution for A12 and A14

### Quality Gates
- **Deliverables:** All artifacts must be completed with professional executive standards
- **Documentation:** Each agent must document methodology, findings, and recommendations
- **Handoff Readiness:** Clear documentation of work completed and next steps for receiving agent
- **Evidence Links:** All claims backed by specific file references or measurable outcomes

### Monitoring & Escalation
- **Status Tracking:** Orchestrator (A1) monitors task progress and agent coordination
- **Blocker Resolution:** Immediate escalation to Project Manager (A0) for resource conflicts
- **Phase Advancement:** Phase 2 coordination begins upon 80% Phase 1 completion
- **Cross-Agent Reviews:** Weekly coordination check-ins for alignment and rebalancing
